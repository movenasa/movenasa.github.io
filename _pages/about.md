I am currently a Master's student at Peking University, Institute of Intelligent Science and Technology, starting in September 2024. I received my Bachelor's degree in Automation from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2024, where I graduated 2nd out of 108 students.

My research interests include artificial intelligence, system security, and software analysis. I am particularly interested in AI-powered security applications and cross-architecture binary analysis.
